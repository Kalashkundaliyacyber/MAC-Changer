# MAC-CHANGER

**MAC-CHANGER** is a Python-based tool that allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface. It can cycle through a list of MAC addresses and periodically update the network interface with a new one. This can be useful for privacy, security testing, or network diagnostics.

## Features

- **Change MAC Address**: Allows you to change the MAC address of your network interface.
- **Periodic Changes**: Automatically cycles through a list of MAC addresses and applies a new one every 10 seconds.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors such as file not found or permission issues gracefully, with appropriate messages displayed.
- **Customizable**: You can easily modify the list of MAC addresses by updating a text file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MAC-CHANGER.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd MAC-CHANGER
   ```

3. Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

4. Create a file named `listmac` and populate it with the MAC addresses you want to cycle through. Each MAC address should be on a new line.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python mac_changer.py
   ```

   - This will change the MAC address of the specified interface (`eth0` by default).
   - The script will read from the `listmac` file and change the MAC address every 10 seconds.

3. To stop the script, press `CTRL+C`.

### Configuring the Script

- **Interface**: The script defaults to `eth0`. You can change this in the script to match your desired network interface (e.g., `wlan0`).
- **MAC Address File**: Ensure the `listmac` file is present in the same directory as the script and contains the MAC addresses you want to cycle through.
